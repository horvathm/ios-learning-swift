/// Closures

/*
 - closures let us take lines of code and group it together to use elswhere in our program
 - function is a type of closure
 - functions can be defined to pass a closure argument
 - in the developer documentation there are methods where the argument is like "(Element) -> String" or "((Element) -> Bool) -> Bool)"
 - code in a closure has access to things like variables and functions that were available in the scope where the closure was created, even if the closure is in a different scope when itâ€™s executed
